We are committed to equitable collaboration and look forward to your contribution. Project groups form in a self-organized way and are open to interested persons from research, companies, the general public or otherwise. The core of our cooperative work is carried out remotely though regular physical meetings between contributors across the world do take place (outside pandemics). If you are interested to learn more about the ongoing projects feel free to reach out to any of the [contributors](https://aiaudit.org/contributors/).
